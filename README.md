# C-Code-Optimization-2

In here, we will defined optimized version of compute1 method as compute2 method. Note that, compute2 and compute1 produce same result, but compute2 method produce same result in much efficient way.

Second optimized code is more efficient than first one.

Use Online C Compiler where language set as C.

Beware, due to many reasons in each run speedup-factor can be different.
