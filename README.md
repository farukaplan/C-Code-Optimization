# C Code Optimization

## Explanation

In here, we defined an optimized version of compute1 method as compute2 method. 
- compute2 and compute1 produce same result, but compute2 method produce same result in much efficient way.
    - You can see the execution time difference between two methods when you run the codes
- Second optimized codes are more efficient than first ones.
- "final" and "optimized" folders are independent from each other

## Run

Use Online C Compiler where language set as C. 
- Due to many reasons in each run speedup-factor can be different.
