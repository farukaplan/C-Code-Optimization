# C-Code-Optimization-2

In here, we will optimize the compute1 method as compute2 method. 

Note that, compute2 is currently just calling compute1. 
Delete the code in the compute2 method and develop your own code.
Your code must produce the same results as compute1 but in a much efficient way.
You can only use the techniques we covered in the course (use of optimizer flags, parallelization, and extensions like AVX are not allowed).
double compute2(unsigned char* data) 
{
    // student code
}
Use Online C Compiler where language set as C.

Beware, due to many reasons in each run speedup-factor can be different. So, test your code 10 times and consider your speedup as the maximum one.
